## Solutions to some of the Project Euler challenges

This repository contains some solutions I implemented to various Project Euler challenges.

All solutions are developed in Erlang (https://www.erlang.org/) for learning purposes.

### What is Project Euler ?

See https://projecteuler.net/

> Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.
